          Indemnity and Release
          </p>
          <p className="text-black  font-serif leading-relaxed">
          You are responsible for your use of the Site, and you agree to release and defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Aegean Capital and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants, affiliates, investors, service providers, business partners, subsidiaries and agents from and against every claim, liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your violation of any of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; (ii) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property right or right of publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (iii) any dispute or issue between you and any third party arising out of your access to the Site.<br/><br/>
          Aegean Capital reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations) and you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim. If the defense or settlement is assumed by you, Aegean Capital may at any time thereafter elect to take over control of the defense and settlement of the claim. You must not settle any claim without Aegean Capital’s prior written consent.<br/><br/>
          You further release Aegean Capital, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or the Site. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides:<br/><br/>
          A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.<br/><br/>
          If you are not a California resident, you waive your rights under any statute or common law principle similar to Section 1542 that governs your rights in the jurisdiction of your residence.<br/><br/>

          Modification of these Terms
          </p>
          <p className="text-black  font-serif leading-relaxed">
          We reserve the right to update or modify the Terms at any time without prior notice, and unless otherwise stated, such changes will be effective immediately upon being posted through the Site. Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your agreement to be bound by the modified Terms.

          General
          </p>
          <p className="text-black  font-serif leading-relaxed">
          Entire Agreement. These Terms (together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal documents, policies, terms, or agreements governing the Site) comprise the entire agreement between you and Aegean Capital with regard to the Site and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the subject matter contained in these Terms.<br/><br/>
          Assignment. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms in whole or in part at any time to any entity without your notice or consent. Any purported assignment by you in violation of this section shall be void.<br/><br/>
          No Waiver. Our failure at any time to require performance of any provision of these Terms or to exercise any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of such provision or such right. All waivers must be in writing. Unless the written waiver contains an express statement to the contrary, no waiver by Aegean Capital of any breach of any provision of these Terms or of any right provided for herein will be construed as a waiver of any continuing or succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of the provision itself, or a waiver of any right herein.<br/><br/>
          Severability. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck, and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law.<br/><br/>
          Governing Law and Venue. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Aegean Capital agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within the State of California.<br/><br/>
          No Agency. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, Aegean Capital, or any third-party provider as a result of the Terms or use of the Site.
